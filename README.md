## Inspiration
  Recently I have found that I needed immunotherapy for my allergies (Allergy Shots) and have finished treatment and gotten a lot better. 
  After going the process I really wanted a way to keep track of my shots and foods I have been eating and see how they coorelate.
  The current apps available doesn't do a great job in user experience.
  Finding the allergy menu at restaurants is annoying.
